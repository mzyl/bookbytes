# bookbytes

### TODO:
- Split into appropriate files
  - Will need to figure out how to work with custom modules in Go after this
  - What files will be needed?
    - Main
    - Is there a reason to split up the rest? 
    - Maybe the rest goes in a single file sectioned off properly
      - BookBuilding functions
      - Paragraph/Navigation functions
      - Helper functions
- Figure out how to move through document starting from original paragraph
  - Maybe try writing function ouput to figure out what input is needed
