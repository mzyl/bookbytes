# bookbytes

### TODO:
- Split into appropriate files
  - Will need to figure out how to work with custom modules in Go after this
  - What files will be needed?
    - Main
    - Is there a reason to split up the rest? 
    - Maybe the rest goes in a single file sectioned off properly
      - Sections have been made in main file for now

- Can move to next and previous paragraphs now
  - Finding chapter and beginning of book are next, I think
    - I don't have a good idea of how to do this across multiple books yet
    - Finding chapter and beginning of book should provide full text scrolling
      - Full text from current location should also be an option
